Conditions/Functions Arduino Program
1) Condition for Defined Pressure Range Applied to Force Sensor 
      a) Before Joypad Mechanism is detected
	
      b) After the Joypad Mechanism is detected
	
 2) Condition for Defined Pressure Release from Force Sensor
     a) Force sensor is used to detect slight pressure release based on Stimulus appearance via Unity Game
     b) Pressure release range depending on "Reaction" or just "reptetitive movement"
     
3) LED Light Off when Joypad button is pressed down vice versa
